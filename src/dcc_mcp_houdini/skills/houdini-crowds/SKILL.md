# houdini-crowds

Typed crowd authoring for Houdini's native agent simulation. Before this package
the adapter had no crowd coverage at all, so agent work had to go through
`execute_python` or generic node creation.

## Tracer-bullet flow

1. `create_crowd_network(parent_path="/obj")`
2. `add_crowd_behavior(network_path="/obj/crowdsim1", behavior_type="steer")`
3. `add_crowd_behavior(network_path="/obj/crowdsim1", behavior_type="avoid")`
4. `inspect_crowd(network_path="/obj/crowdsim1")`

## Behaviors

| `behavior_type` | SOP/DOP |
|---|---|
| `steer` | `crowd_steer` |
| `avoid` | `crowd_avoid` |
| `seek` | `crowd_seek` |
| `follow` | `crowd_follow` |
| `trigger` | `crowd_trigger` |
| `geometry` | `crowd_geometry` |
| `pop` | `crowd_pop` |

`add_crowd_behavior` attaches the node to the next free input of the network's
`crowdsolver`; pass `connect_to` to target a different node. With no solver the
node is created unattached and reported with `setup_state="unattached"`.

## Honesty contract

- `create_crowd_network` returns `setup_state="skeleton"` and never claims
  `simulation_verified=true`; an agent definition, agent source geometry and a
  cook are still required.
- `inspect_crowd` reports structure only (`validation_scope="graph_structure"`):
  it says whether a solver, a crowd object and behaviors exist, not whether the
  crowd simulates.
- This package has no `skipped_parameters` field: parameter overrides go through
  `parameter_edit`, so an override the node does not expose **fails the call and
  rolls back** rather than being skipped. See the naming rule in the bake and
  light-rig skills.
- Creation failures destroy only the nodes owned by the failed request.
